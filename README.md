# Review Paper: Analysis of the Riemann Hypothesis

This paper was written as part of my coursework in Semester 4 at VIT Vellore. It explores the Riemann Hypothesis â€” its mathematical background, significance in number theory, and implications for prime distribution.

In addition to a literature review, I used MATLAB and Python (with `mpmath` and `matplotlib`) to:
- Visualize the behavior of the Riemann zeta function
- Plot trivial and non-trivial zeros
- Experimentally validate aspects of the hypothesis through computational analysis
